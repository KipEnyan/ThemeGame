We should probably get out of here.
People are panicking, I'm outta here.
Someone here is not who they appear to be.
I don't want to stick around to see what happens next.
Someone pulled a knife here at the party, that's all I know.
They say that the man with a {hat} hat did this, but nobody is sure.
The man with a {tie-color} has something on his suit. Is that wine... or blood??
Uh oh...
I wouldn't linger if I were you.
There's a body here, someone was murdered.
Do you know where the exit is?!? I'm leaving.
There's blood everywhere, my friends and I are getting the hell out of here.
Call the cops, someone is dead.
You should leave.
Something horrible has happened.
How could anyone do such a thing?
