Wow, I love the extravagance of this party!
The sangria is excellent, I suggest you try some.
It's pretty funny watching people try to dance in their costumes.
I checked out the bathrooms earlier, talk about a porecelain throne!
I like your {color}{mask}, I haven't seen anything quite like it before!
Where did you find that {color}{body}, a flea market?
The pork was absolutely delicious.
It's fun to gaze out these huge windows, it's a beautiful night out.
This mansion is huge! This is my first time attending a part here.
Have you seen the guy with a {color}{mask}? His costume makes me uneasy.
